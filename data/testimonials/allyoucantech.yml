text: At AllYouCanTech we needed a simple solution for deploying and maintaining daily curated data. Aerobatic enabled us to go to market in only a couple of weeks, with zero concern around setting up servers, databases, or scaling resources, while knowing the content was distributed globally and delivered using the latest web standards.
# After researching our options, it became clear that a static site generator along with Aerobatic's out-of-the-box features like CDN and HTTP/2 would provide not only the simplest but also the most robust solution for our type of service.
