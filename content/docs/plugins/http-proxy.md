# HTTP proxy plugin

The `http-proxy` plugin is a high performance, intelligent proxy that supports proxying AJAX requests to remote http endpoints. In addition to simple pass-through proxying, it also supports caching, parameter injection (to querystring, path, and body), as well as response transforms. In the `aerobatic.yml` router, you can define one or more instances of the proxy plugin.

For CORS support, declare this plugin in conjunction with the [cors plugin](/docs/cors).

### Basic Configuration

Declare the proxy plugin in your `aerobatic.yml`:

~~~yaml
plugins:
  - name: http-proxy
    path: /api/geocode
    options:
      url: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json
      query:
        key: $GOOGLE_API_KEY
---
~~~

In this case, weâ€™re defining our own `/api/geocode` endpoint on our Aerobatic web app which proxies to `maps.googleapi.com`. Additionally a `key` querystring parameter is tacked onto the remote call with our Google API key which is stored as an environment variable.

#### Client Code

To invoke this proxy endpoint in client JavaScript, we might do something like so:

~~~js
$.ajax({
  url: "/api/geocode",
  data: {
    address: "Timbuktu"
  },
  success: function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  },
  error: function(data) {
    console.error(data);
  }
});
~~~

The actual URL sent off to Google would then be: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?key=XYZ&address=Timbuktu`. Importantly the client JavaScript never has anything to do with the API key, that remains entirely on the server-side.

### Named Parameters Route Setup

If you are proxying many different operations to a remote API, it would be tedious to setup a separate virtual route for each and every endpoint. Instead you can use named parameters to configure all these routes in one go. For example say you are communicating with a remote API that exposes the following endpoints:

* `GET /widgets`
* `GET /widgets/123`
* `POST /widgets`
* `DELETE /widgets/123`
* `GET /users`

You can configure named parameters with optional path segments to proxy all of these endpoints in a single add-on declaration. By omitting the `method` property, all HTTP verbs will be matched.:

~~~yaml
plugins:
  - name: http-proxy
    path: /api-proxy/:resource/:id?
    options:
      url: https://some-remote-api.com/:resource/:id?
      query:
        apikey: $SOME_REMOTE_API_KEY
---
~~~

### Wildcard Routes

An even more flexible approach is to configure one route that will forward on all path segments starting with a `*`.

~~~yaml
plugins:
  - name: http-proxy
    path: /api/*
    options:
      url: https://some-remote-api.com/api/v1
      query:
        apikey: $SOME_REMOTE_API_KEY
---
~~~

The proxy will translate the incoming request to the origin API like so:

`GET /api/widgets/12345` __=>__
`GET https://remoteapi.com/api/v1/widgets/12345?apikey=xxx`

`POST /api/users` __=>__ `POST https://remoteapi.com/api/v1/users?apikey=xxx`

### Caching

For http responses that don't change frequently or to avoid strict rate-limits, Aerobatic allows you to cache API responses on our servers as well as on the CDN. Just specify a `cacheMaxAge` option with the number of seconds the API response is valid for. Subsequent requests to the same URL will be served directly from the CDN or at the very least from the Aerobatic web servers, but the request will not be proxied off to the true origin server until the TTL has expired. This can be a great way to boost performance of an API that is out of your control.

~~~yaml
plugins:
  - name: http-proxy
    path: /api/cacheable
    options:
      url: http://someapi.com/rarely-changes
      cacheMaxAge: 600   # Cache with TTL of 600 seconds
