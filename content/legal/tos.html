<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
              <p>These Policies, Guidelines, and Disclaimer are intended for all web sites residing on Aerobatic LLC&#39;s servers. We ask that all clients reselling our hosting services in any way, implement these same Policies, Guidelines, and Disclaimers into their own web sites to ensure that the same are understood and met by their clients.</p>

<p>Aerobatic web hosting is a technical service that requires knowledge of generally accepted web hosting and design practices. Our service is built around the fact that our customers have this knowledge. If you do not have sufficient knowledge to manage a web site, you must be willing to learn or hire someone that does. Our technical support department can help you, but cannot act as an individualized instructor to teach you about web design and hosting for every step of the way. You are expected to have some knowledge of web hosting and design in order to utilize our services.</p>

<p>You are responsible for maintaining the code that you deploy on our servers. This includes security and backups.</p>

<p>You are expected to log in to your web site control panel and manage your web site with the tools available there. Instructions will be sent in a welcome email.</p>
