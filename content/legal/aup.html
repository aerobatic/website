<h3>2. General Prohibitions.</h3>

<p>2.1. You may not use this site or Aerobatic LLC’s Services for any purpose that is unlawful or in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the operation of this site, the Aerobatic LLC Network, or Aerobatic LLC’s Services, or any other party’s use or enjoyment of this site, the Aerobatic LLC Network, or Aerobatic LLC’s Services.</p>

<h4>2.2. Adult Content Prohibited.</h4>

<p>2.2.1. Adult-oriented sites demand special system, network, and bandwidth requirements. Aerobatic LLC does not accommodate those extraordinarily large requirements in its hosting plans. Therefore you may not use Aerobatic LLC’s services for adult-oriented and pornography sites. This includes sites that may include sexual content, or links to adult content elsewhere.</p>

<p>2.2.2. Where allowed by applicable law, Aerobatic LLC does not prohibit you from posting a static Web page that meets all of the following criteria:</p>

<p>the page merely advertises an adult service and provides information about how to contact the service offline, i.e., by telephone, facsimile, or postal mail and not via a link from a Web site that uses Aerobatic LLC’s services;</p>

<p>the page does not display any sexually explicit content and does not link to any Web page or site displaying any sexually explicit content; and</p>

<p>the page does not require a user to log in with a username or password to access any of the Web site’s content.</p>

<p>2.2.3. In some jurisdictions, even the notice and advertisement of adult-oriented services may be illegal. It is your sole responsibility to learn the laws that govern what you are and are not allowed to post on your Web site. As part of your agreement with Aerobatic LLC, you must comply with all such applicable laws.</p>

<p>However, Aerobatic LLC cannot and does not advise you or make any recommendations to you about the existence of any such laws in a particular jurisdiction. Nor does Aerobatic LLC advise you about how to comply with any such laws. Furthermore, laws vary throughout the United States of America and all over the world, so you should contact your legal advisor for more information and specific recommendations concerning the kinds of online materials that are legal in your region.</p>

<p>2.2.4. If you use Aerobatic LLC’s service to publish any content that any applicable law deems “harmful,” “inappropriate,” or “unsuitable” for minors (persons under 18 years of age), then you must provide appropriate protection to prevent minors from accessing that content. Such protection is your sole responsibility because Aerobatic LLC does not censor the content of your Web sites and pages.</p>

<p>2.2.5. You may not use Aerobatic LLC’s services to sell or solicit sales for any of the following items, products or services because they are or may be illegal in one or more jurisdictions where Aerobatic LLC’s services are offered, or where they can be viewed through Aerobatic LLC’s services:</p>

<p>Online pornography or adult content for which a viewer must subscribe to access it,</p>

<p>Adult content-related products or services (including X-rated videos, pictures, etc. especially of individuals under 18 years of age), and</p>

<p>Obscene materials, as defined by law.</p>

<p>If we find any of your sites to be selling any of the prohibited products or services, the offending accounts shall be subject to immediate account termination.</p>
