<h2>Help with unsupported issues</h2>

<h5>Databases and Application Servers</h5>

<p>Atlassian provides integration instructions for getting their products to work on supported platforms, but we do not support configurations that differ from the procedures described in the Atlassian product documentation. We test on common platform combinations. However, we expect that you test our add-on in a development environment in order to ensure that your platform combination runs without issues. If you do encounter issues in any environment, please provide us feedback via <a href="mailto:support@aerobatic.com">support@aerobatic.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/aerobaticapp">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h5>Atlassian Beta Releases, Development Releases, Release candidates</h5>

<p>Aerobatic does not offer support for milestone or beta releases nor support release candidates of Atlassian products.</p>
