This week, we're excited to announce the introduction of paid plans for our [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) static website hosting service.

And, unlike other static hosting providers, you don't need to invent your own Babbage Engine to understand our pricing.

You get 2 free sites. After that, it's $2 per site per month. Just `git push`, we'll host your static site on a CDN, and you get all the features below. That's up to 1/10 the cost of most other providers. Simple. Straightforward. No B.S. [What are you waiting for](https://bitbucket.org/account/addon-directory/)?
