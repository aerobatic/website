[Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is a RStats package, created by [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui), that acts as a wrapper for the awesome [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to create a simple blog in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) using blogdown and then quickly deploy the resultant website onto Aerobatic's global Content Delivery Network.

## Pre-requisites
We'll assume you already have the following installed on your machine:

* [Rstats](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/)
* [Aerobatic CLI](https://www.aerobatic.com/docs/getting-started/)


## Step 1: Setup

In RStudio, we'll enter the following:

```r
setwd('/mydirectory/blog')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')
library('rmarkdown')
library('blogdown')
```

## Step 2: Create Site

It's important to note that `blogdown::new_site()` requires an empty directory. So, when you `setwd()` earlier, make sure that directory is empty. Continuing in RStudio:

~~~r
blogdown::new_site()
blogdown::install_theme('jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect')
blogdown::new_post('Using Blogdown and Aerobatic to Publish A Blog About RStats')
options(servr.daemon = TRUE)
blogdown::serve_site()
~~~

At this point, we have a new site, we've created a new blog post, and we're now serving the site up locally. When you created a new post, RStudio automatically opened a new tab with a basic post that contained some front matter. We're now going to go ahead and edit that [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) file.

## Step 3: Edit R markdown file

~~~r

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```
We can do a lot with blogdown and Aerobatic!

# This is a plot
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

# This is some code
```{r mpg}
summary(mpg)
fit <- lm(hwy ~ displ, data = mpg)
fit
```
~~~

## Step 4: Deploy to Aerobatic

In RStudio, go to Tools > Shell. This will open up the command line utility. Make sure you are in the root folder of your new blog. Assuming you've already installed the [Aerobatic CLI](https://www.aerobatic.com/docs/getting-started/):

~~~bash
[$] aero create
[$] aero deploy -d public

Deploy new Aerobatic website version to stage production

     Compressing website assets
     Uploading archive to Aerobatic
     Waiting for cloud deployment to begin
     Cloud deployment in-progress

Version v1 deployment complete.
View now at https://blogdown.aerobatic.io
~~~

At this point, our site is now live on the Internet at https://blogdown.aerobatic.io, and as you can see, our code and plot are nicely embedded in the page.

## Next Steps

From here, we could perhaps decide to [password protect](/docs/plugins/password-protect/) our site. Another option might be to take things a step further and set up [Continuous Deployment](/docs/continuous-deployment/)  (CD) with a tool like Travis or Bitbucket Pipelines. Indeed, [this tutorial](/blog/hugo-bitbucket-pipelines/) shows how to set up CD for a Hugo site using Bitbucket Pipelines, and [this tutorial](/blog/hugo-github-circleci/) shows how to set up CD with CircleCI.
