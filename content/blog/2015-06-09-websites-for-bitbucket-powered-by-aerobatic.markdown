At Aerobatic, our mission is to empower front-end developers to innovate faster - less time spent thinking about infrastructure; more time spent developing amazing customer-facing experiences, less time spent building and maintaining custom toolchains; more time spent innovating with clients, less time switching contexts between disparate tools; more time spent coding in a seamless flow.

####Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket
We are therefore excited to announce that today, as one of the initial launch companies of the Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket program, more than 3 million Bitbucket developers and 450,000 teams are now empowered to create, manage, and deploy web applications to the cloud from within the Bitbucket UI, using the Aerobatic add-on for Bitbucket.

####Ideal for Static Sites And Single Page Apps
Whether you have a Jekyll blog, a static site documenting your open-source project, or a full-featured web app built with a framework such as AngularJS, Ember, or React, you can now now edit your code, push your changes to Bitbucket, and your site will be deployed automatically.

####More than basic hosting
As with all web apps running on Aerobatic, we provide more than just dependable hosting for developers, with CDN, custom domains, and versioning included in this initial version, and more helpful features coming soon including SSL, starter templates, and configurable server middleware that powers API integration, oauth, web hooks, and more.

If you are currently a user of Bitbucket and want to take a sneak peak, click on your avatar, select "Manage Account", and install the new Aerobatic add-on by selecting "Find new add-ons" from the left menu.
