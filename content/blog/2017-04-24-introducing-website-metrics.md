We're happy to announce the availability of a new Metrics tab in the Aerobatic dashboard. It's intended to provide an easy way to glean important insights about your website traffic including: visits, page views, browsers, visitor locations, devices, top pages, traffic sources, and more. Our design drew inspiration from popular WordPress stats plugins such as [WP Power Stats](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-power-stats/) and [WordPress.com Stats](https://jetpack.com/support/wordpress-com-stats/).

It's not a full Google Analytics replacement by any stretch, but it's also far less daunting. You can absolutely use it in addition to GA. And importantly, unlike GA, it's powered off your website CDN logs rather than client JavaScript, so it's not affected by ad blockers. Ad blockers have a growing impact on the completeness of JavaScript based stats collectors &mdash; by some studies [over 11% of users have GA blocked](https://www.quantable.com/analytics/how-many-users-block-google-analytics/#update1). See the article [How Many Users Block Google Analytics, Measured in Google Analytics](https://www.quantable.com/analytics/how-many-users-block-google-analytics/) for a comprehensive look at this topic.

Your Aerobatic web metrics are kept completely private and not shared with any 3rd parties. Only you and members of your Aerobatic team account have access.
